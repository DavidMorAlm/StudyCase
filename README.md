![Figure #1. Scenario Topology](/documentacion/assets/images/Topology.png "Figure #1. Scenario Topology")

### Scenario

It is a small to mid-size company with corporate offices and a branch. This company contracted a
service provider for Cloud Computing services in the mode of IaaS for their 250 servers, also the
service provider will help in the management activities remotely in such a way that they have to make
the necessary configurations to allow the company to access the company's servers.

The architecture of the LAN has a 'hierarchical design' (Access, Distribution, Core), which meets the
design requirements of a fault tolerant network, scalability, QoS, and security.
